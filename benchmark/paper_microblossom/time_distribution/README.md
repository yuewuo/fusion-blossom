In order to use [the Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law) to estimate the potential speed up,
we need to understand how much time are spent on the tasks that could be sped up.

The dual phase can be sped up. The primal's simple matching patterns can be sped up.
Others are not, especially the alternating tree operations.

Let's see the distribution on a circuit-level noise
